The lines represent Coloumb barriers - sweeping along G3 manipulates electrochemical pot. of Si quantum dot with G2 and G4 manipulating the tunneling barriers:

*Each line represents the transmission of a single electron*

Double Dot Stability:

*As C<sub><sub>m</sub></sub> shifts from 0 to C<sub><sub>m</sub></sub>/C<sub><sub>1,2</sub></sub> = 1 through adjusting G4 voltage:*
